From then on, mobile apps have totally changed everything in our lives. Such the revolutions of software happen about every decade:\\n\\nIn the 1980s, most apps were running in [command-line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface).  \\nIn the 1990s, the [desktop app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software) shaped the modern software in GUI.  \\nIn the 2000s, the [web app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application) delivered software as online services.  \\nIn the 2010s, the [mobile app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app) brought software along our side.\\n\\nBut after the mobile app wave, we\'ve kept asking: **What is the next-gen app?**\\nFrom Chatbot to VR to Web3, several technology hypes have passed, but none of them became a phenomenon.\\nToday, in 2022, it\'s still a mystery.\\n\\n## Social Media Age\\n\\nHowever, one thing is certain: everything is on the social media now. We know the revolution of apps always comes after the prosperity of platforms. This has happened on PC, Web and mobile devices. And social media is the hottest platform today.\\n\\n<img src={require(\\"./assets/social-media-status-2022-4.png\\").default} />\\n\\n> <small>Social media is dominant and still fast growing - <i>DataReportal (2022), <a href=\\"https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2022-global-overview-report\\">\u201cDigital 2022: Global Overview Report\u201d</a></i></small>\\n\\nRemember the days that every business/organization/campaign built their own apps?\\nPeople [just don\'t download such various apps](https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/25/majority-of-u-s-consumers-still-download-zero-apps-per-month-says-comscore/), instead, a few social media only.\\nWhile our time and attention continuously move to social platforms, so do all kinds of businesses and services as well.\\n\\nBut how can we build software on the social media?\\n\\n### Apps on Social Platforms?\\n\\nWe\'ve actually tried shipping automated services on the instant messaging, that\'s the [Chatbot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot).\\nIts future seemed to be bright since the chat platforms is so popular.\\nUnfortunately, it finally failed because of:\\n\\n- **Lack of programmatic features**. Most bots only provide little static content.\\n- **Poor user experiences**. It\'s hard to optimize chatting UI/UX.\\n- **Messaging UI is limited**. So they can\'t provide complicated features as in GUI.\\n- **No social media support**. Chatbots only work on chat platforms.\\n- **No standard UI**. So the development ecosystem failed to grow.\\n\\nThe problem is how do we made these bots:\\n\\n<img height={500} src={require(\\"./assets/no-code-tools.png\\").default} />\\n\\n> <small>Popular tools for chatbot: BotFramework(\u2196), DialogFlow(\u2197), BotPress(\u2199) and Rasa(\u2198).</small>\\n\\nThese no-code tools have only so limited and inflexible functions that caused the problems above.\\nIf you look at history, it\'s almost impossible make useful software without programming logic.\\nHowever, if we do have a programming solution that fix these issues,\\nit could be the key to the next-gen app.\\n\\nThat\'s the reason I spend last 3 years developing the [Sociably.js](https://github.com/machinat/sociably) framework, which brings a brand new way to make apps on social platforms.\\n\\nI call it _Sociable App_.\\n\\n## Sociable App = Social Media + Chatbots + Web App\\n\\nA sociable app does these works seamlessly:\\n\\n- Managing social media accounts\\n- Communicating to users as a chatbot\\n- Shipping features in an extended web app\\n\\nSo it\'s not only a chatbot, a web app or an automated social account.\\nIt combines them all in one app that provides even better user experiences.\\n\\nBelow, I\'ll show you how it works with [a sociable Wordle game](https://twitter.com/WordleMachina).\\n\\n### Enter from Social Media\\n\\nThe original Wordle has a problem: lack of an entry point.\\nA sociable app can manage its own social media accounts, which work as the entry of the app.\\n\\n<video height={400} autoplay=\\"autoplay\\" loop inline muted playsInline>\\n  <source src={require(\\"./assets/wordle-social-media.mp4\\").default} type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n> <small>Users can access the app and use it on Twitter.</small>\\n\\nOn social media, it can promote a campaign, interact with users and serve community-oriented features.\\n\\n<img width={300} src={require(\\"./assets/wordle-like.png\\").default} />\\n\\n> <small>The app can do social media operations directly</small>\\n\\nThis solves the traffic source issue of web apps. And it also means the app can market itself automatically.\\n\\n### Communicate by Messaging\\n\\nThe app then points users to the private messaging chat, which is the core of the app.\\nIt provides 1-on-1 services here with the most friendly UI, the human language.\\n\\n<video height={400} autoplay=\\"autoplay\\" loop inline muted playsInline>\\n  <source src={require(\\"./assets/wordle-chat.mp4\\").default} type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n> <small>The app serves statistics and notification features in chatroom</small>\\n\\nIn the chat, it can provide basic features like menus, guides and notifications.\\nSociably has all the tools you need to build UI/UX in a chat, including rich message formats, chat flow and intent recognition.\\n\\n### Advanced Features in Webviews\\n\\nThen the app can open a webview to provide more complicated features in the chatroom.\\nIn the example, it\'s the Wordle game itself.\\n\\n<video height={400} autoplay=\\"autoplay\\" loop inline muted playsInline>\\n  <source src={require(\\"./assets/wordle-webview.mp4\\").default} type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n> <small>Users play the game in a connected webview</small>\\n\\nThe webview can serve unlimited features and experience in GUI like a web app.\\nIn addition, it\'s securely linked with the chatroom and you can smoothly switch between them.\\n\\nAnother common usage is extending the chat experiences,\\nlike showing rich data or selecting complicated input.\\nLike in another example:\\n\\n<video height={400} autoplay=\\"autoplay\\" loop inline muted playsInline>\\n  <source src={require(\\"./assets/pomo-settings.mp4\\").default} type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n> <small>Update a form in a more visualized way</small>\\n\\n### All Platforms, All Features\\n\\nMoreover, all the utilities mentioned above are cross-platform.\\nThis means everyone on social network can easily access your app.\\n\\n<video height={400} autoplay=\\"autoplay\\" loop inline muted playsInline>\\n  <source src={require(\\"./assets/wordle-cross.mp4\\").default} type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n> <small>The app is cross-platform that also works on Messenger, Telegram and LINE (in order)</small>\\n\\nOne issue for cross-platform apps is we often need to customize UI/UX and logic for each platform.\\nSuch optimization can be easily done too.\\n\\n<video height={400} autoplay=\\"autoplay\\" loop inline muted playsInline>\\n  <source src={require(\\"./assets/wordle-optimize.mp4\\").default} type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n> <small>In Messenger, it requires one special step to notify after 24 hr</small>\\n\\nFurthermore, Sociably.js can support all the features of all the platforms.\\nSo we can always optimize user experiences using any native feature.\\n\\n### One Integrated UI\\n\\nFinally, the social media, the chatbot, the web app are integrated seamlessly.\\nThus, sociable apps can ship a unified experience just as in one app.\\n\\n<video height={400} autoplay=\\"autoplay\\" loop inline muted playsInline>\\n  <source src={require(\\"./assets/wordle-whole.mp4\\").default} type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n> <small>The app works smoothly on Twitter</small>\\n\\nSociably.js integrates these mechanisms as one revolutionary UI.\\nIt\'s _standardized, cross-platform and extensible_ so developers can easily build 3rd-party UIs, plugins and even platforms.\\nThis make it possible for the ecosystem to grow together.\\n\\nThat\'s the key to the next-gen apps.\\n\\n## The Impact\\n\\nThe UI revolutions before had not only changed the software, but also how everything works in our world.\\nWe think sociable apps is going to make these new changes:\\n\\n### The Revival of Lightweight Apps\\n\\nSociable apps are super easy to use, because:\\n\\n- you don\'t need to download or log in\\n- you can access them on any device\\n- you use them by simply chatting\\n\\nIt\'s perfect for the lightweight apps that have once prospered on mobile devices.\\n\\n<video height={400} autoplay=\\"autoplay\\" loop inline muted playsInline>\\n  <source src={require(\\"./assets/pomo-example.mp4\\").default} type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n> <small>A pomodoro timer that is always available to you</small>\\n\\nIt may especially fit small games, informational apps and apps for an event/location/store.\\nThese apps benefit from the social media traffic the most.\\n\\n### Personification of Software\\n\\nA sociable app can have its own image and personality on social media. It can be either original or linked to an existing character.\\n\\n<video height={400} autoplay=\\"autoplay\\" loop inline muted playsInline>\\n  <source src={require(\\"./assets/holo-image.mp4\\").default} type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n> <small><a href=\\"https://github.com/lrills/HoloPomodoro\\">HoloPomodoro</a> is a pomodoro timer with VTuber image</small>\\n\\nA well-designed image helps users to know it, recognize it and get closer to it.\\nThis makes it like a real-life NPC.\\n\\n### Automating Social Media\\n\\nBusinesses spend lots of human resources on social media today, mainly for marketing and customer services.\\nA sociable app can automate these works and save huge cost.\\n\\n<video height={400} autoplay=\\"autoplay\\" loop inline muted playsInline>\\n  <source src={require(\\"./assets/cs-example.mp4\\").default} type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n> <small>The sociable app naturally fits customer services</small>\\n\\nIt also enables some new strategies on social media, like a gamified experience.\\n\\n<video height={400} autoplay=\\"autoplay\\" loop inline muted playsInline>\\n  <source src={require(\\"./assets/sm-example.mp4\\").default} type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n> <small>A gamified marketing example</small>\\n\\nAnd to a developer, since you always need to promote your app on social media, why don\'t you develop a sociable app at the beginning?\\n\\n### The Omni-Channel App\\n\\nIn the future, Sociably.js will support every platform that uses human language.\\nThat includes SMS, email, voice assistants and embedded chat in websites or mobile apps.\\n\\n<img width={500} src={require(\\"./assets/omni-channel.png\\").default} />\\n\\n> <small>Sociable app can serve on all the media for communication</small>\\n\\nTherefore, the marketing, sales and customer services can all be programmed into one app.\\nFor example:\\n\\n<video height={400} autoplay=\\"autoplay\\" loop inline muted playsInline>\\n  <source src={require(\\"./assets/travel-example.mp4\\").default} type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n</video>\\n\\n> <small>Integrating other services and apps smoothly</small>\\n\\nThis provides one unified user experience to the customers everywhere, which implements the [_omni-channel experience_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnichannel) automatically.\\n\\n## Try It Today\\n\\nToday, the environment is more ready than the days of chatbot hype.\\nSocial media is even more popular.\\nTechnologies like intent recognition are mature.\\nPlatforms\' support is complete since [Whatsapp finally opened the cloud API](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2022/05/19/whatsapp-cloud-based-api/).\\nIt\'s time for the revolution to happen.\\n\\nSociably.js makes it super easy to build sociable apps.\\nYou can create an app with one command; run it and start developing in minutes; launch the app in merely one day.\\nIt\'s the most efficient way to reach users in this social media age.\\n\\n<img height={500} src={require(\\"../static/img/start-dev.webp\\").default} />\\n\\n> <small>Initiating a sociable app is super easy. The video is played in real time.</small>\\n\\nFor now we support 4 platforms: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/), [Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/), [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) and [LINE](https://line.me/).\\nWe\'ll keep supporting more in the future,\\nand plan to cover all the mainstream platforms this year.\\n\\nYou can start your first app from [our tutorial](https://sociably.js.org/docs/learn/).\\n\\n## Join Us\\n\\nOur goal is to ship software on all social platforms.  \\nSo apps can provide features in real life, everywhere, all around us.  \\nSo they can ease the social media works and bring amazing new strategies.  \\nSo they can serve in our most familiar way, like a close friend.\\n\\nHowever, to push such a paradigm shift, it\'s not only about a framework.\\nIt requires the whole ecosystem!\\n\\nThe more people join, whether to develop apps, packages or the framework itself, the more we can push this vision forward.\\nImagine that an app can learn telling jokes by simply adding a component.\\nThat can even possibly lead us to build better AI!\\n\\nIf you are a developer, you can find more resources on [the GitHub repo](https://github.com/machinat/sociably).
